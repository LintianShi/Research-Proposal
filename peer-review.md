​	The author proposes a machine learning method to reduce redundancy of the test suites generated by Rndoop, a random testing tool. The author mainly proposes two techniques of test suite reduction. One is that using a machine learning model to predict the coverage of test cases, we can remove the very low-coverage test suites. The other is that we can remove the similar test cases using a machine learning approach to measure the similarity of two test cases. Furthermore, the author tests several different machine learning models and find the best model.

​	**Strengths**

* a valuable problem, which can help software testing practically

* clearly effective technique, well described

* the author integrates the techniques into the tool Randoop

​    **Weakness**

* the author does not give a evaluation that the Randoop integrated these techniques has a better performance that other random testing tools. There is only an evaluation that their machine learinng model is better than existing works. However, it is still a question that whether the author's work can really help the programmer in the aspect of testing.

​    **Comments for Authors**

​	I enjoyed reading this paper. It is logical and clear. I can catch the point easily and feel easy to read. The problem is a real problem we may face during the testing. The techniques proposed are feasible and there is a good evaluation of them.

​	There are a few, relatively minor issues that can be addressed to improve the paper even further.

​	I think machine learning is very popular nowadays and many people may attempt to solve the test suite reduction by using machine learning approach. What is the main difference between your method and others' ? What's the key point of coming up with your method?  If you can answer these question in your paper, your paper will be even better.

​	In the paper, you show that your models have a better performance than other existing models and the test suite size is expected to be reduced by 20% on average compared to the initial test suite. If you can give an evaluation that the coverage of the reduced test suites is almost the same as before, it will better since I do not see any picture or table about this aspect.

* The author gives the clear requirement of the version of JDK and the version of maven. The author give the list of dependencies with precise version.
* The author gives no command line tool. Users have to type a very long command, *'java -javaagent:jmtrace-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar -jar yourJAR'*, to use the tool. It is very inconvenient because you cannot use autocompletion. In addition, the generated program is actually named *jmtrace-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar*, not *jmtrace-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar* in README.
* The program cannot work correctly for my two testcases. The program will throw error that *'Exception in thread "main" java.lang.VerifyError: Bad type on operand stack'*. Maybe the author do not consider the double-byte type like long and double.
* The author puts some unnecessary files like *.editorconfig* into the package.

* The author gives the clear requirement of the version of python and the list of dependencies with precise version. However, in ubuntu 18.04 the user cannot use apt-get install to get python3-fire. The user should use pip to install the dependency and using pip is more elegant.
* The author gives a script which is convenient, but not a command line tool. There is not any help information or other options like verbose. It is user-unfriendly in some sense.
* The program can correctly give the similarity of two codes in my testcases. Two similar codes have a point which is more than 80, and two different codes have a point around 20.
* The author do not put any unnecessary files into the package.

* The author gives the requirement of operating system and the version of Make.
* The command line tool has no additional options such as --help and --verbose. The user cannot get any help information or more details from execution. Moreover, the user has to copy Codesim to the folder /bin, which is not elegant.
* The program can correctly give the similarity of two codes in my testcases. Two similar codes have a point which is more than 90. If two codes are different from each other, the program will give a very low score. However, the program gives a score that is a decimal between 0 and 1, not a percentage which is required.
* The author do not put any unnecessary files into the package.
